Feel Sketch is a fun tool (application) that you can experience AR ,augmented
reality, with your own drawings.

Feel Sketch will automatically convert your illustrations and images into
PM-Code.

PM-Code can be printed, so the Feel Sketch Browser in the smart phone can read
the PM-Code.

The image or illustration that you drew on Feel Sketch will show up on AR.

This is a worlds first application tool that your contents can be shown by AR
without Internet environment and having to put data in the application
forehand.

Please enjoy the easy and simple AR [Sketch](Feel.md) tool.
