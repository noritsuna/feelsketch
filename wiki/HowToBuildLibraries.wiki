= C++Library =
PM-Code is constructed by three C++ Libraries listed below.
 * PMCodeCommon
  *Common parts of the encoder and the decoder.
 * PMCodeDecoder
  *The decoder. Converts PM-Code data to binary data.
 * PMCodeEncoder
  *The encoder. Converts binary data to PM-Code data.

== Build ==
{{{
cd feelsketch/lib/cpp
./configure
make
sudo make install
}}}

= How JNI Library is organized. =
Presently, JNI Library’s encoder is only offered.
 * PMCodeEncoderJNI
  * JIN Library for the encoder.
  * Depends on both PM-Code Common and PM-Code Encoder.。

= Building of JNI Library =

== Download ==
Check out from this site.

== Preparation ==
Install JDK.
http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp

Always, select the JDK directory in the environmental variable JAVA_HOME.

ex)
{{{
export JAVA_HOME=/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6.0/Home
}}}

== Build ==
{{{
cd feelsketch/lib/jni/PMCodeEncoderJNI
./configure
make
sudo make install
}}}

= JNI sample =
== Build ==
{{{
cd feelsketch/lib/sample/jni-sample
javac jp/co/cia/pmcode/PMCodeEncoderSample.java
javac jp/co/cia/pmcode/PMCodeEncoderJNI.java
}}}
==Perform ==
=== Mac OSX ===
{{{
./run_osx.sh
}}}
=== Linux ===
{{{
./run_linux.sh
}}}
==Conferm ==
If a file “pmcode.bmp” is created successfully, then the sample works.
Open the image file.
